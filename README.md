# MSPORT Betting Scraper

The **MSPORT Betting Scraper** is designed to collect upcoming football match data from the MSPORT website. The scraper fetches match details, including odds for home win, draw, and away win, and saves the data into a CSV file for further analysis or use in betting strategies.

## üìå Features

- **Automated Data Scraping**: Automatically scrapes football match information and odds from the MSPORT website.
- **Scroll Automation**: Handles infinite scrolling on the MSPORT page to load additional match data.
- **CSV Output**: Outputs all relevant match details (e.g., time, teams, odds) into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensures there are no duplicate entries in the CSV file.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes a headless browser session using Selenium and navigates to the MSPORT football matches page.
2. **Page Interaction**: The script scrolls down the page multiple times to load additional matches.
3. **Data Extraction**: The match details (time, teams, odds) are scraped from the page and structured into a usable format.
4. **Data Storage**: The scraped data is saved to a CSV file.
5. **Duplicate Handling**: The script ensures that duplicate match entries are removed from the CSV file.

### Key Components:

- **Selenium**: Used for browser automation, including scrolling and interacting with web elements.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes the match information into dictionaries for structured data storage.
- **CSV File Management**: Manages saving the match data into CSV files and ensuring no duplicates.
